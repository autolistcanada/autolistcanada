The icon files (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) need to be replaced with actual icon images of the following sizes:

- icon16.png: 16x16 pixels
- icon48.png: 48x48 pixels 
- icon128.png: 128x128 pixels

The icons should follow the AutoList Canada brand guidelines:
- Deep green primary color
- Gold/orange accent color
- Abstract geometric nature theme

Since actual binary image files cannot be created through text-based tools, please create these icon files using an image editor software.

Once created, the icons will be displayed in:
- Browser toolbar
- Extension management page
- Chrome Web Store (if published)
- Installation dialog

For temporary testing purposes, the extension will work with the empty placeholder files, but real icons should be added before final deployment.
